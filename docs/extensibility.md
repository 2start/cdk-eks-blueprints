# Extensibility

## Overview

SSP Framework is designed to be extensible. In the context of this guide, extensibility refers to the ability of customers and partners to both add new capabilities to the framework or platforms based on SSP as well as customize existing behavior, including ability to modify or override existing behavior.

There are several pluggable abstractions that can be leveraged to add new features to the framework. 

- Add-ons. Customers and partners can implement new add-ons that could be leveraged exactly the same way as the core add-ons (supplied by the framework).
- Resource Providers
