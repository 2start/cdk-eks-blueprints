# Team Support 

The blueprint provides support to register a number of teams for cluster access. 
Teams could be workload teams, who share the cluster using namespaces, or platform teams (one or more) who have admin access (masters) to the cluster.

## Classes and Interfaces

Basic requirements to add a team is to implement `TeamSetup` interace. It requires to declare team name and implement `setup` method. 
Team names must be unique, otherwise the blueprint validation will throw an exception.

Support classes include two convenience base classes:

`teams/Team` class provides support for the following:
    - register IAM users for cross-account access
    - provide an existing role for cluster access
    - if role is not provided and users are provided, then a new role is generated by the blueprint automatically
    - create namespace
    - register quotas
    - register provided users/role in the `awsAuth` map for `kubectl` and console access to the cluster

`teams/PlatformTeam` class provides support for the following:

 - register IAM users for admin access to the cluster (`kubectl` and console)
 - register an existing role (or create a new role) for cluster access with trust relationship with the provided/created role
